# What is this?

This repo contains my code I wrote following along with [Crafter Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). Namely, the first half with the tree walking-interpreter.

Currently working through chapter 6, with the error handling. I also need to implement the printing, to verify the correctness.

# TODO:

Better error messages (need to use Tokens in the parser, rather than the TokenTypes / Expr)
