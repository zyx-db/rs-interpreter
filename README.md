# What is this?

This repo contains my code I wrote following along with [Crafter Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). Namely, the first half with the tree walking-interpreter.

Currently working through chapter 6, with the error handling. I also need to implement the printing, to verify the correctness.

# TODO:

- fix infinite loop when repl has capitals (I think it is due to pRint being interpreted as an identifier, and we lack support as of now).
